                <p>Besides the creative work contained in this site, I have worked in various roles in politics, governmental organizations, international mining projects, and education. </br>
                </br>

                I currently teach Web Design and Applications in Technology at Shih Chien University (as of 2018). I also give workshops in creative coding and programming, and occasionally topics from previous experience in international relations. </br>
                </br>

                I also am Content and Technical Director for a creative coding and programming academy called Skyrock Projects. </br>
                </br>

                My interests span a wide spectrum of the arts, politics and natural (as in nature) activities. I hope I can express them in my work. </br>
